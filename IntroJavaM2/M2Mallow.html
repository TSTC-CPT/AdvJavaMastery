            <p>
                Event tickets are sold at the Mysterious Candle Event Center every full moon for the wildly popular marshmallow sacrificing event. The event center has 5 tiers of seating available for purchase. Each tier comes with a price based on supply and demand from the swarm of attendees that flood the stadium every full moon. </p>
<p>
    The most sumptuous seating is reserved for those who offer the largest marshmallows (and by extension, the deepest pockets). This is area is known as the Alter Ring. Next in line come the VIP suites. Then the Box seats, the Patron’s Chairs and finally the cheap seats. The base price of each tier is 20% higher than the tier below it. VIP Suits cost an additional $200 over the 20% increase. The price of the cheap seats is set at random from $2.50 – $70.99. The price of all seats go up an additional 5% after 1,000, 5,000, and 10,000 seats are sold in each section. </p>
<p>
Write a program that calculates the price of the seats. Start the base price of the cheap seats using a computer generated random number. Display the results in table format.
    Prompt the user for the total number of seats sold in each section. Display the total revenue for each section and the grand total for the entire event. </p>
