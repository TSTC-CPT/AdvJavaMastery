        MySQL Mastery Assignment
    </div>
    <main>
        <div class=unselectable>
            <p>For this assignment you will be setting up tables in your own MySQL database. Check the course announcements for your connection string information. Do not use the connection string in the video. Information in your program will now need to be saved and retrieved from the remote database. This includes all account information, lodges, and images. Every member variable in the Employee, Customer, and Lodge class must be in the database tables. Use a single/shared connection variable for all of your database operations. Open the connection at the beginning of database operations and close the connection when the operations for a set of data are complete. Include the SQL driver .jar file in your project folder and link it accordingly using a relative path. Files will now serve as backup in case of database or connection failure. First, attempt to use the database, if the connection fails, resort to using the local files.</p>

            <p>Images will need to be incorporated into the program for the lodges. The Customer and Employee views will display several images for each lodge. Provide a preview area using a JScrollPane or JPanel with a <a class=info target=_blank href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/flow.html">FlowLayout<span>opens in new window</span></a>. The preview viewport must show at least 5 images. Reduce the preview size of the image to a thumbnail. If a user clicks on an image, a large carousel window will open, allowing the user to cycle through large scale versions of the images. This carousel window must be a minimum of 720x1280 pixels in size. Display the image that was clicked on. This is the only popup window allowed in the program. Add an ArrayList to your Lodge class to store the images for each lodge. When a lodge is selected, query for the images. Save the images in that lodge's ArrayList and display the thumbnails. Retrieve the images from the ArrayList to display them in the carousel window. Scale the image using <a class=info target=_blank href ="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Image.html#getScaledInstance(int,int,int)">getScaledInstance()<span>opens in new window</span></a>. Set a fixed height corresponding to the carousel window's viewport. Use the ratio of the original height to the new height to calculate the image width. Your images should not appear stretched or squished.</p>

            <p>The customers orders will also need a table in the database. When a customer places an order, store all relevant information as a row in this table so it can be used for collecting order history. The user side of your interface is required to use the MM/DD/YYYY format for all dates shown. Make conversions as needed to interact with the database. </p>

            <p>The Employee view will allow the user to add images to a lodge. Use the <a class=info target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JFileChooser.html">JFilechooser<span>opens in new window</span></a> to select image files and allow the user to select multiple image files at once. Set a filter to make locating PNG and JPG images easier. The images will be stored in the database. Create a separate table for the images and link them to the lodges with a foreign key. Make sure each lodge can support as many images as the employee wants to add. Verify that additions and edits to the lodges are updated in the Employee and Customer views. When a lodge is removed, delete the images linked to it as well.</p>


            <p>Add HTML reports to your program. Use CSS to add color and style to your reports in <a class=info target=_blank href=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp>HTML table<span>opens in new window</span></a> format. Customer reports will show order history for a selectable time frame for the current user. Inform guests that they will need to create an account to have access to order history. Employee reports will list all customers and their total spending for a selectable date range. All time frames will be selected with date selector comboboxes. Open the report in the default browser and save a copy of the HTML file in a local folder called “Reports”. Store the Reports folder in the user's Documents folder (Windows OS). You can get the path to the Documents folder with this code: </p>
            <code>FileSystemView.getFileSystemView().getDefaultDirectory().getPath()</code>

            <p>Optimize your program by reducing the number of calls to the database to a reasonable minimum. Avoid sending queries in a loop or KeyListener. Add a refresh button to the Customer and Employee views to reload and refresh the table data from the database. This can be helpful for debugging or verifying information if the connection fails. Only reload the data relevant to the current view. Keep all of your table creation and startup data scripts. Add the scripts to your project folder in a single text file. Image uploads should only be done from the interface and are not a part of these scripts.

            Submission notes:
            The project must be turned in as a zipped Netbeans (Ant) project.<br>
            The project must be named accordingly. <strong>FirstNameLastNameM#</strong>, where # is the module number. Example: JohnDoeM1 <br>
            Briefly comment your code and include a heading in your main file to specify the module number. <br>
            Classes should be developed in separate files. Code must use the naming convention specified by the course instructor. Also be sure to follow all rules listed in the course and in the syllabus.
