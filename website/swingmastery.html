        Swing Mastery
    </div>
    <main>
        <div class=unselectable>
            <p>For this assignment you will be moving the existing program into a GUI format using Java Swing. Create a design that streamlines all of the functionality of the console program. Avoid simply replacing the console menu options with individual buttons. Then begin by adding to your existing state classes. The program must use the existing code structure. Abandoning the existing state classes or effectively replacing them with new ones will fail the assignment.   
            </p>
            <p>
                Use one large JFrame as your main program window. Resize it as needed for each state. Each state of the program will have at least 1 JPanel to operate out of. List the JFrame and JPanel as members of the State class. The JPane should be static (one), the panels should not (one per state). You may add aditional Jpanels as needed. Use buttons and/or a <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html target=_blank>menu<span>opens in new window</span></a> system to change states. Hide and show the JPanels according to the current state. Try to arrange the components on the JPanels in a way that is organized and professional. Every state should have a 'Log out' button that will return the user to the login panel.</p>


            <p>
                Components<br>
                Derive at least 3 of your own classes from existing classes like JButton and JTextField to avoid having to set individual properties each time you add a component. Most of the update code from the state machine will now be handled by the swing components and <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html target=_blank>action listeners.<span>opens in new window</span></a> Comment out the state machine loop for this module. Redesign the user experience by moving away from the menu style of  previous modules. Instead, use Labels, TextFields, Buttons, and other swing components to create a modern GUI. Again, use your derived variants for these Jcomponents. Use RadioButtons or CheckBoxes for boolean inputs. Declare the components as members of the state class they belong to (CustomerView, Login etc). Initialize their values and add the action listeners in the constructors. For example, a password field for the login state would be declared as a member of the Login class. It would be configured in the Login constructor. </p>
            <p>Login and Account Registry<br>
                Use the JLabel to label the inputs for name and password. Use JTextField and JPasswordField for input. Always mask the password field. This should look like a typical login form with <a class=info target=_blank href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/button.html>JButtons<span>opens in new window</span></a> to Register, Login, Continue as Guest, or Exit. Create a separate JPanel for registering. When the user is registering a new account provide real time updates on the strength and validity of the password using a <a class=info href="https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/docs/questions/?api=java.awt.event.KeyAdapter" target=_blank>KeyListener or KeyAdapter.<span>opens in new window</span></a> You can use a labels such as 'Length', and 'Special Character' along with Unicode symbols like ✔️, and ❌ to indicate what is missing and when the password is sufficient. If you don't want to use the symbols you could also change the color of the labels to indicate if that requirement has been met. The indicators must be dynamic and change in real time as the password text is modified. Each password requirement must have a separate indicator. When reading the input from the password field, do not use the deprecated getText() method, use getPassword().</p>
            <p>Customer View<br>
                The customer view will provide a list of lodges read in from the file created in the previous assignment. There are several design options here, but the user must be able to scroll through the different lodges so a <a class=info href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JScrollPane.html" target=_blank>JScrollPane<span>opens in new window</span></a> must be implemented. You may want to combined it with a JList or JTable to list the names of the lodges. All lodge information must be retrieved from the file for each lodge and displayed when that lodge is selected. Pictures will be added for each lodge in a later assignment so leave some room for a thumbnail viewing area. From this point the customer will need to be able to select a lodge and a date range for their stay. You may use 3 comboboxes for Month, Day, and Year as a date range selection tool. Use the <a class=info href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html" target="_blank">GregorianCalendar<span>opens in new window</span></a> class to populate your calendar. The comboboxes should only offer valid dates. The Calendar class will help take care of which months have which days, including leap years. To calculate the time span over a date range, you may refer to the following code:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>
                  int day = 10;
                  int month = 4;
                  int year = 2023;
                  // create first date (hardcoded)
                  LocalDate d1 = LocalDate.of(2023,3,23);
                  // create 2nd date (using variables)
                  LocalDate d2 = LocalDate.of(year,month,day);         
                  //calculate the number of days between dates.
                  long diff = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(d1, d2);         
                  System.out.println("Total days in ranage: " + diff);
                </pre>
                </div>
                <p>Employee View<br>
                    Transfer the functionality of the console program into the GUI. Use the JScrollPane component with a JList or JTable to display the file contents. The employee will have the option to add pictures to the selected lodge in the next assignment so allow some room for that in your design. Use JButtons or a <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html target=_blank>menu<span>opens in new window</span></a> system to add, edit and remove lodges from the program. Clear the input fields when a lodge has successfully been added. Leave room for 2 sets of date selection combo boxes (similar to the customer view) and a button labeled "Get Report". Implementation for the dates and reports will be added later.</p>
                <p>Manager View<br>
                    The Manager View development will be left behind with the console at this time. Nothing to do here.
                <p>Refinement<br>
                    Add polish to your program by making it robust and user friendly. Use labels or a non-editable text area to update the user of the current status of the program. If an employee adds a new lodge successfully it may be good to clear the fields for the next entry (depending on your design) Avoid using annoying popup message boxes to give status updates. Validate the user’s input and disable buttons that should not be clicked until there is valid input to work with. Add color to your program. Choose a business professional pallet with good contrast and at least 4 colors. Check out <a class=info href=https://colordesigner.io/ target="_blank">ColorDesigner.io<span>opens in new window</span></a> for some good ideas and easy to use copy/paste color schemes. Provide a link to the scheme you chose as a comment in the main file. </p>
                <p>Things to Avoid<br>
                    Avoid creating additional classes that change the structure of the existing program. Instead, work with what has already been established in the previous modules. Check with your instructor if you need to add a class outside of what the assignment calls for. Also do not declare static variables or methods unless you have a reason to. Review what the static keyword does and when to use it. Finally, avoid error messages. Test your program over and over again while keeping an eye on the console ouput. If your program is throwing errors it will heavily impact your grade.

        </div>
        <p>
                Correct any issues from the previous module to avoid carryover penalties. <br>
            TEST YOUR WORK THOROUGHLY BEFORE YOU SUBMIT.<br>
            The project must be turned in as a zipped Netbeans (Ant) project.<br>
            The project must be named accordingly. <strong>FirstNameLastNameM#</strong>, where # is the module number. Example: JohnDoeM1 <br>
            Briefly comment your code and include a heading in your main file to specify the module number. <br>
            All classes should be developed in separate files.<br> Code must use the Java naming convention. <br>
            Be sure to follow all rules listed in the course and in the syllabus. 
            Contact your instructor if you have any questions.
