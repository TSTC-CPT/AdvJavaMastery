    <main>
        <div class=unselectable>
            <p>For this assignment you will be moving the existing program into a GUI format using Java Swing. Use one large JFrame as your main program window. Resize it as needed for each state. Each state of the program will have at least 1 JPanel to operate out of. List the JFrame and JPanel as members of the State class. Use buttons and/or a <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html target=_blank>menu<span>opens in new window</span></a> system to change states. Hide and show the JPanels according to the current state. Try to arrange the components on the JPanels in a way that is organized and professional. Every state should have a 'Log out' button that will return the user to the login panel.</p>


            <p>
                Components<br>

                Most of the update code from the state machine will now be handled by the swing components and <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html target=_blank>action listeners.<span>opens in new window</span></a> Comment out the state machine loop for this module. Redesign the user experience by moving away from the menu style of  previous modules. Instead, use JLabels, JTextFields, JButtons, and other swing components to create a modern GUI. Use RadioButtons or CheckBoxes for boolean inputs. Create a design that streamlines all of the functionality of the console program.</p>
            <p>Login and Account Registry<br>
                Use the JLabel to label the inputs for name and password. Use JTextField and JPasswordField for input. Always mask the password field. This should look like a typical login form with <a class=info target=_blank href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/button.html>JButtons<span>opens in new window</span></a> to Register, Login, Continue as Guest, or Exit. You may create a separate JPanel for registering. When the user is registering a new account provide real time updates on the strength and validity of the password using a <a class=info href="https://www.programcreek.com/java-api-examples/docs/questions/?api=java.awt.event.KeyAdapter" target=_blank>KeyListener or KeyAdapter.<span>opens in new window</span></a> You can use a labels such as 'Length', and 'Special Character' along with Unicode symbols like ✔️, and ❌ to indicate what is missing and when the password is sufficient. If you don't want to use the symbols you could also change the color of the labels to indicate if that requirement has been met. The indicators must be dynamic and change in real time as the password text is modified. When reading the input from the password field, do not use the deprecated getText() method, use getPassword().</p>
            <p>Customer View<br>
                The customer view will provide a list of lodges read in from the file created in the previous assignment. There are several design options here, but the user must be able to scroll through the different lodges so a <a class=info href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JScrollPane.html" target=_blank>JScrollPane<span>opens in new window</span></a> must be implemented. You may want to combined it with a JList or JTable to list the names of the lodges. All lodge information must be retrieved from the file for each lodge and displayed when that lodge is selected. Pictures will be added for each lodge in a later assignment so leave some room for a thumbnail viewing area. From this point the customer will need to be able to select a lodge and a date range for their stay. You may use a few comboboxes for Month, Day, and Year as a date range selection tool. Use the <a class=info href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/GregorianCalendar.html" target="_blank">GregorianCalendar<span>opens in new window</span></a> class to populate your calendar. The comboboxs should only offer valid dates. To calculate the time span over a date range, you may refer to the following code:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>
                  int day = 10;
                  int month = 4;
                  int year = 2023;
                  // create first date (hardcoded)
                  LocalDate d1 = LocalDate.of(2023,3,23);
                  // create 2nd date (using variables)
                  LocalDate d2 = LocalDate.of(year,month,day);         
                  //calculate the number of days between dates.
                  long diff = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(d1, d2);         
                  System.out.println("Total days in ranage: " + diff);
                </pre>
                </div>
                <p>Employee View<br>
                    Transfer the functionality of the console program into the GUI. Use the JScrollPane component with a JList or JTable to display the file contents. The employee will have the option to add pictures to the selected lodge in the next assignment so allow some room for that in your design. Use JButtons or a <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html target=_blank>menu<span>opens in new window</span></a> system to add, edit and remove lodges from the program. Clear the input fields when a lodge has successfully been added. Use a <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/tabbedpane.html target=_blank>JTabbedPane<span>opens in new window</span></a> with tabs to separate the manager view from the employee view. Disable or hide the manager tab when the user is not a manager. Leave room for 2 sets of date selection combo boxes (similar to the customer view) and a button labeled "Get Report". Implementation for the dates and reports will be added later.</p>
                <p>Manager View<br>
                    The manager view will also implement everything in the console program. No pictures will be needed here. Use a JTable and JScrollPane to organize and modify employee information. The information will need to be loaded and saved to the file. You may want to use JButtons or add a <a class=info href=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/menu.html target=_blank>menu<span>opens in new window</span></a> system to implement these functions in your program. Managers will be able to move freely between the employee view and the manager view by clicking on the corresponding tab. You can add the same Jpanel to multiple places in your program but you will need to remove it from the previous location first. </p>
                <p>Refinement<br>
                    Add polish to your program by making it robust and user friendly. Use labels or a non-editable text area to update the user of the current status of the program. If an employee adds a new lodge successfully it may be good to clear the fields for the next entry (depending on your design) Avoid using annoying popup message boxes to give status updates. Validate the user’s input and disable buttons that should not be clicked until there is valid input to work with. Add color to your program. Use a pleasant pallet with good contrast. Check out <a class=info href=https://coolors.co/ target="_blank">Coolors<span>opens in new window</span></a> for some good ideas and easy to use copy/paste color schemes. Provide a link to the scheme you chose as a comment in the main file. Derive your own classes from classes like JButton and JTextField to avoid having to set individual properties each time you add a component. </p>
