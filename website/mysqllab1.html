            <p>This program will allow a user to log into and access a remote database. The program will work with a single table and the user will be able to insert information into that table. They will also be able to view all of the information in the table. </p>
            <p>Begin with a small login window that prompts for a name and password. Add a tooltip to the name and password labels that reveals the correct name and password for you database. If the user enters the wrong credentials clear the password field. </p>   
            <p>If the connection is successful expand the Jframe or close the original and open a larger one. The program will access a single table in the database called People. You will need to create this table in your schema and populate it with at least 3 entries. This table should have columns for name and age. On the left side of the window provide 2 labeled text fields, 1 for name and 1 for age. On the right side show all of the data in the table in rows and columns. You may use Labels, a JTextArea, JTextPane or JTable (shown) to display the information. </p>
            <p>There will be 2 buttons on the second window: “Add” and “Close”. Clicking Add will verify the name and age fields contain valid information. If the name and age are valid:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add them to the database</li>
                    <li>Refresh the window with the new data that is being read from the database</li>
                    <li>Clear the name and age fields</li>
            </ul>
                <p>If the information is not valid indicate which is not correct by changing the background color of that field to light red or dull pink.</p>
            <p>You may want to use the Netbeans form builderfor this project. It can make the design phase a little easier but also comes with its own learning curve. </p>
            <p>You can add a form builder file by right clicking on the project → new → Jframe Form<br> This will come with its own main() method so youmay want to scrap the original main file. </p>
            <p>The auto alignment can do more harm than good if there are several objects on one frame. <br>To turn off auto alignment: right click→ Set Layout→ Absolute Layout</p>
