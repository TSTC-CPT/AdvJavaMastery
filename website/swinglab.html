        Swing Lab
    </div>
        <main>
        <p>Create a small swing program that provides 2 input boxes for the user to enter a name and password.
            Label each of these fields accordingly. The interface should include at lease 1 image such as a logo.There should also be 2 buttons labeled “Save” and “Quit”. Make the quit button’s text red. Set the other button’s background color to any you choose.</p>
            
            <p>Validate and mask the password.It should be at least 6 characters long and contain letters, digits and a special character. (space may count as a special character)As long as the password is invalid provide an error indicator to let the user know the password is invalid. You may choose to make the font red, or show a red error label or image to the right side of the password text field. Be sure to hide this indicator when the password is valid or if the text field is empty. The Save button should also be disabled but still visible while the password is invalid. Apply a <a class="info" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/event/KeyAdapter.html" target = _blank>KeyAdapter<span>opens in new window</span></a> to update the indicator.</p>
            <p>Clicking the Save button will save the name and password to a file named info.txt. (provided the password is valid) Use a lambda function with an ActionEvent to define what the button does.</p>
            <p>Clicking the Quit button will end the program in any case. </p>
            <p>Keep the program’s appearance and functionality looking very professional. The color scheme, font, size, component placement and spacing, should look like a quality, professional application.</p>
            <p>Do not use any form building software. This program should be hand written with your own code.</p>
