            This program will allow the user to add, edit and remove a list of names stored in a file, similar to a database.</p>
        <p>Present the user with the following menu:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Display Data</li>
            <li>Add New Entry</li>
            <li>Edit Entry</li>
            <li>Remove Entry</li>
            <li>Exit</li>
            
        </ol>
        <p>Your program will run in a loop and implement each of the actions listed.</p>
        <p>Display Data will read in a file called names.txt and display the names in numbered order.</p>
        <p>Add New Entry will prompt the user for a name to add to the file.</p>
        <p>Edit Data will show the list of numbered names and prompt the user to enter the number for the name they would like to edit. That name will be replaced with the new name that is entered by the user. Validate the user's input.</p>
        <p>Remove Entry will display the numbered list of names and prompt the user for the number of the name to remove. Remove this entry from the file.</p>
        <p>Validation specs: Each name should contain only letters and spaces. There is no limit to the number of spaces. If you choose to use regex for validation, the pattern(s) must be throughly commented and explained or you will not receive any credit for the validation.</p>
        <p>Thoroughly test your program and make sure that when you are done the data in the text file is correct. You can check this by opening the file in Netbeans or notepad. Do not number the names in the file, only when displayed.</p>
        <p>Hint: To edit the file, first copy the contents to an array. Edit the array, then overwrite back to the file.</p>
