    <main>
    <p>Modify the travel agency program to store information in files. All account and lodging information will be stored in at least 2 text files. You will need to determine the best format for storing your program’s information. The program must be able to add an indefinite number of people or lodges to the files as well as edit or remove existing entries. The menu options will need to be updates to reflect the new functionality that will be gained by using files. Text files are required, binary files will not be accepted for this project. 
    </p>
    <p>Login State<br>
        The login menu options will not change but the way they function will. All accounts must be stored in the account file. You may choose to have a separate file for employees and customers or place all Persons in the same file. Registering a new account will add that account to the file. The file will need to store all relevant information pertaining to that person. All of the information will also need to be read from the file to create the Person objects and populate the ArrayLists. Encrypt the passwords before saving them in the file. Write your own encrypting and deciphering algorithm. It doesn’t need to be complex. Make sure your load() and save() methods are polymorphic.</p>
    <p>View States<br>
        The other states will act in a similar way. All data must be read in from the files and the class objects will be created from that data before they are added to the ArrayList. New Lodges and Employees that are added to the program will also be added to the files. </p>
        
    <p>Editing <br>
Add the options to remove and edit existing entries. Employees will be able to edit and remove existing lodges. Managers will be able to edit and remove existing employees. Update the files accordingly. Editing should include options to edit the names, passwords, and price per night. </p>
        <p>Remove any previously hardcoded entries. The Manager and Employee accounts should be loaded from your files. Verify the Manager and Employee login credintials from the previous mastery still work. The starting lodges should also be loaded from the files. You can load your startup data before you enter the state machine loop.</p>
        <p>Again, load() and save() must be polymorphic methods to receive credit for this assignment. If your load or save methods are static or have arguments being passed into them, you probably did it wrong.</p>

            Submission notes:
            The project must be turned in as a zipped Netbeans (Ant) project.<br>
            Your name must be part of the project name, i.e. JohnDoeMastery <br>
            Briefly comment your code and include a heading in your main file to specify the module number. <br>
            Classes should be developed in separate files. Code must use the naming convention specified by the course instructor. Also be sure to follow all rules listed in the course and in the syllabus.
