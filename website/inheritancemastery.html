        Inheritance Mastery Assessment v1.45
    </div>

        <p>
          In this program you will begin creating classes for the Punching Parrot Travel Agency beginning with a lodging booking service. A lodge (or lodging) is the general term for a place to stay. Lodges may be a home such as an Air B&B or a standard hotel. In this assignment you will be developing some classes for the various objects that will be used in the travel agency’s program. You can test the classes by writing a console program to work with the classes. Objects will be created from the classes. These objects can then be used in the program. You may test all of your classes if you wish but only submit what is required later in this assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Develop the classes listed in the bullet points below. Determine which classes should take advantage of inheritance and derive them accordingly. Each class should have at least 2 constructors. The first is the default constructor and the second is defined to your liking. All member variables must be defined in the constructors. Subclass constructors must invoke the base class constructor. Remember that anytime inheritance is used you should be able to say: &ltchild class name&gt is a &ltparent class name&gt. Example: Orange is a Fruit. If this statement doesn’t make sense, then inheritance should not be used in this way. Incorrect Example: Hero is an Inventory. Neither Hero or Inventory would be derived from one another. Some classes such as HotelRoom will stand alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the classes you must develop for this assignment.

            The classes will need member variables. It is left as an exercise to the programmer to determine which class they belong to. Some of these members, like ‘name’ will go in multiple classes. Add 3 of your own unique variables to the Hotel class and 2 unique variables to the House class. Check out some hotel booking websites if you need ideas. Remember that a class is a blueprint for objects as they exist in the program. All variables listed below must be used and all classes have at least 2 from the list. The variables must belong in the class you choose to place them in. Remember to move any variables that are common to all subclasses up to the base class to make the most of inheritance.

        <p>
            Override the toString() method for each class. When called this method will return a String with the labeled values of the member variables. Subclasses should call the base class’s toString() method to show inherited values. Keep all output clean and professional. Monetary values should be formatted to show 2 digits after the decimal place. This format is required throughout the course.
        </p>
        <p>
           Choose at least 1 standalone class to have private variables. Provide getter and setter methods for the member variables of this class. All other classes and members may use default access 
        </p>
        <p>
            In main() create 5 instances of lodgings using your lowest levels of subclasses and the non-default constructors. Make sure the values are a little different from place to place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Call toString() on all of the objects and display the returned string to the console. 
        </p>
           <p>
            Submission notes:
            The project must be turned in as a zipped Netbeans (Ant) project.<br>
            The project must be named accordingly. <strong>FirstNameLastNameM#</strong>, where # is the module number. Example: JohnDoeM1 <br>
            Briefly comment your code and include a heading in your main file to specify the module number. <br>
            Classes should be developed in separate files.<br> Code must use the Java naming convention. Also be sure to follow all rules listed in the course and in the syllabus. 
            Contact your instructor if you have any questions.
