    <p>Overview<br>
        Write a program that takes advantage of multithreading to sort a large array of random numbers. 40,000 numbers may be a good starting place. The range of these number should be between 1 and the size of your array. Measure the time efficiency of multithreading versus a single thread implementation. Execute the efficiency test 10 times for each sort and store the time it takes for each pass in an array. Set the size of the array with a variable so the size can be changed in one place for the entire program. </p>
            <p>Sorting and Threading<br>
                Write a Bubble Sort algorithm to sort the array of random numbers. Use a bool to cancel the sort early if the values are completely sorted. Adjust the array size as needed for your hardware. A good time frame is around 4 seconds. Sort time is affected by your computer's processor and the size of the array. Repeat the sort using a copy of the original array but use 2 threads, half of the array to each thread. Then merge the 2 halves by writing a merge algorithm. You can use a new array to store the result. Measure the time difference between multithreaded sorting and single thread sorting. Repeat this process 10 times with 10 different arrays and log the time difference in a text file. Label each output in the file. Calculate the average single sort time, average threaded sort time and the average difference as a percent. Write these 3 values to the end of the file with a label. </p>
            <p>System.nanoTime() can be used for the timer. Set the time before the sort, and then subtract that time from the current time after the sort is complete. The goal is to determine how much faster a 2 thread bubble+merge sort is, compared to a single thread bubble sort on the same array of numbers. If the program is working correctly, you should see X4 speed improvement using 2 threads (on a large array). Adjust the size of the array so that the finish time is around a couple seconds. Convert your times stamp output to something more meaningful such as seconds or milliseconds.</p>
            <p>Tips on the merge: For this part of the program you only need to compare the values of both sorted array halves and take the lowest value. Then go to the next number in that array and compare again.  The values you are comparing will seldom be the same index so you will need 2 different variables to keep track of the indexes.</p>
            <p>Example:
                <pre>
                Array1 (sorted)     Array2 (sorted)
                1                   3 
                3                   3
                4                   6
                7                   8
                
                Merged Result: 1 3 3 3 4 6 7 8
                </pre>
            
            </p>
            
            
        </div>
