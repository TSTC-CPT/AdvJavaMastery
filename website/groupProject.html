Hotel Booking Application<br>
<h6>Java Group Project</h6><br>
    </div>
        <main>
        
      
        
<p><strong>
Overviewüî≠</strong><br>
Create an application that simulates a hotel booking service. The app will have 2 views, one for the
customer and one for the booking agency. Customers will be able to select dates, locations, and book
hotel reservations. Employees of the booking agency will be able to view bookings, update hotel
information and check revenue generated by customers using the app.
            </p>
<p>
            <strong>Employee View</strong>üë®‚Äçüíº<br>
The employee view will be accessed when a user logs in with an employee account. This will be the
only thing that determines which view is used. No check boxes or other indicators will be used to
access the employee view. Employees will be able to:
            </p>
    <p>
            <ul>
                <li> Add, remove and update hotels in the system</li>
                <li> View all bookings</li>
                <li>View all revenue over a specified date range (a small percentage of all bookings)</li>
                <li>View customer information including total spending</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
<p>
<strong>Customer View</strong>üôÇ<br>
Customers will be able to choose a date range and a location. Dates must be selectable from a calendar
GUI. Customers will then be presented with a listing of hotels available in that location. Hotel listings
should include a brief description, ratings, pricing, room availability and a few pictures representing
that hotel. Customers will also need the option to create an account or sign in. When a customer has
logged in they will be able to see their currently booked hotels and account history. From account
history a customer will be able to rate a previous hotel stay.
            </p>
            <p>
<strong>Database</strong>üóÇÔ∏è<br>
Data will be stored on a remote MySQL database. An ERD should be drawn up as an early priority.
Hotel information, bookings, customer accounts and employee accounts should all be stored on the
database. The database should be populated with 3 customer accounts including account history and at
least 1 employee. The names are c1, c2, c3 and e1, and the password must be password for all of these
accounts. Use these accounts to thoroughly test your program and demonstrate its functionality when
                graded.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Hotel Data</strong>üè®<br>
You will need at least 10 distinct hotels and 5 locations. A location must have at least 3 but no more
than 8 hotels. Some hotels may be used in multiple locations (hotel chain). These hotels may use the
same name, images and descriptions but room availability, ratings and pricing should be independent.
                Hotel names and locations may be real or fictional.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Team Coordination</strong>üó®Ô∏è<br>                
AA github repository will be assigned to your team for your project. You may use git through Netbeans
to perform most github actions. Each team member is required to maintain their own branch. Each team member
must push their own branch to github at least once a week before Monday. Teams are required to merge 
their branches, push to the repository, and create new branches from the merged product every Monday.
</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Calendar UI/UX </strong>üìÖ<br>
Java does not include a date or date range selection tool so it will need to be created from swing
components and Java‚Äôs GregorianCalendar class. Use a grid or gridbag layout for the dates on the
calendar. Dates must be Jlabels in the grid. Allow the user to change month by clicking on the currently
displayed name of the month. Do the same for the year. Calendars should open to the current date. Use
different background colors on your date Jlabels to indicate selected dates or a date ranges. Use the
mouse adapter to selected and deselect dates. This code needs to be written by the team. If the code 
                used can be traced back to any other source it will be counted as cheating.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Quality</strong>ü•á<br>
Validate all information that can be entered by a customer. Watch the dates and numbers. Do not allow
customers to book hotels for days in the past. Use a separate thread when optimal to retrieve data from
the database. Avoid using excessive popup windows, messages or inconveniences that have a negative
impact on the user‚Äôs experience. During the final polishing stages it‚Äôs a good idea to have friends or
                family to test and give feedback on the program.</p>
<p>
<strong>Evaluations</strong>üìù<br>            
All students are required to fill out an evaluation for their team. This part of the assignment is to be
completed separately and should be kept private from other teammates. Failure to submit an evaluation
will result in a 25 point deduction from the student‚Äôs project grade. Grades will start at a base value
determined by the quality of the application and be adjust for each individual student according to
evaluations. Evaluations should be a short text document explaining your contributions and your
teammate‚Äôs. Explain how well you worked together or if the other student(s) took too much control or
were lazy. No more than 500 words. Git activity may also be weighed into the evaluation. Evaluations
will have a separate submission link on Moodle.</p>
