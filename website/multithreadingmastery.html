        Threading Mastery Assignment

        <p>
Optimize your program by executing the queries in your program on a separate thread. Only run queries for the data needed in the current view. When loading the data for the lodges, query the database for all of the information on houses and hotels except for the images. Query for images when a lodge is selected. Execute that query on its own thread. Update your application’s interface and ArrayLists as each row from the result set as it is read in. The thumbnails should appear in the flowpane, one by one. Use the Lodge's image ArrayList to display the images in the image viewer. You should be able to move about the program freely as the images and other data load in real time. If the program stalls during the query then the threading is not correct.</p>
 <p>       
When an employee uploads multiple images for a lodge, provide a status indicator to show the progress of the uploads. You can use a progress bar, Unicode progress bar, or a simple label that shows x/n images have been uploaded, where x is the current image and n is the total number of images being added. </p>

Change the connection model from open and close, to constantly open. Add error handling to automatically deal with a lost connection. If the user gets disconnected and attempts to access the database, use try/catch blocks to reestablish the connection. Provide a connection status indicator as a label on your application. Change the status text and color when the connection is broken/reconnecting, or is connected. Check the connection status on a loop using a separate thread and a timer. Once every 3 – 5 seconds is usually a good interval. </p>
