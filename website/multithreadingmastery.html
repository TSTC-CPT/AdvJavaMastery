        Threading Mastery Assignment

        <p>
Optimize your program by executing the queries in your program on a separate thread. Only run queries for the data needed in the current view. When loading the data for the lodges, query the database for all of the information on houses and hotels except for the images. Query for images when a lodge is selected. Execute that query on its own thread. Update your application’s interface and ArrayLists as each row from the result set as it is read in. The thumbnails should appear in the flowpane, one by one. Use the Lodge's image ArrayList to display the images in the image viewer. You should be able to move about the program freely as the images and other data load in real time. If the program stalls during the query then the threading is not correct. Do not use any delay or sleep methods to slow down the threads.</p>
 <p>       
When an employee uploads multiple images for a lodge, provide a status indicator to show the progress of the uploads. You can use a <a class=info target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JProgressBar.html">JProgressBar<span>opens in new window</span></a>, Unicode progress bar, or a simple label that shows x/n images have been uploaded, where x is the current image and n is the total number of images being added. </p>
  <p>      
Change the connection model from open and close, to constantly open. Add error handling to automatically deal with a lost connection. If the user gets disconnected and attempts to access the database, use try/catch blocks to reestablish the connection. Provide a connection status indicator as a label on your application. Change the status text and color to correspond to the connection status. Check the connection status on a loop using a separate thread and a timer. Test your work by disconnecting the internet to your computer. Count how long it takes for the status indicator to change. Then reconnect the internet and note how long it takes to reconnect.  3 – 5 seconds is usually a good interval. All exceptions must be properly handled or printed to the console. </p>

            Submission notes:
            The project must be turned in as a zipped Netbeans (Ant) project.<br>
            The project must be named accordingly. <strong>FirstNameLastNameM#</strong>, where # is the module number. Example: JohnDoeM1 <br>
            Briefly comment your code and include a heading in your main file to specify the module number. <br>
            Classes should be developed in separate files. Code must use the naming convention specified by the course instructor. Also be sure to follow all rules listed in the course and in the syllabus.
