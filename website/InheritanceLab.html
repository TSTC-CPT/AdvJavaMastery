        <p>Create a base class called Vehicle. Add the following members:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>year</li>
            <li>make</li>
            <li>model</li>
            <li>display()</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Derive subclasses called Automobile and Motorcycle with the following members:</p>
        <p>Automobile:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>number of seats</li>
            <li>hasManualTransmission</li>
            <li>towingCapacity</li>
            <li>display()</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Motorcycle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>wheelCount</li>
            <li>engineSize</li>
            <li>display()</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Derive 2 more classes from each of these 2 subclasses. You will need to think of 2 specific Automobiles and 2 specific motorcycles and create classes for them. This program will then have a total of 7 classes. Each class must have at least one constructor.</p>
        <p>These last 4 classes only need to contain a constructor and no other methods. Use these constructors to set all of the member variables.</p>
        <p>In main() create an array of 4 Vehicles. Assign each element of the array an object from each of your 4 lowest level subclasses. Create the objects using constructors. Use super to call the base class constructor. Use a for loop to call display() on all 4 objects.</p>
        <p>The display() methods will show the labeled values of the class’s member variables. You may print directly from the method, or return a String to main()</p>
