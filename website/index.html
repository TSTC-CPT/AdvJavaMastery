        Inheritance Mastery Assessment v1.3
    </div>
    <main>
    <div>
        <p>
          In this program you will begin creating classes for the Punching Parrot Travel Agency beginning with a lodging booking service. A lodge (or lodging) is the general term for a place to stay. Lodges may be a home such as an Air B&B or a standard hotel. In this assignment you will be developing some classes for the various objects that will be used in the travel agency’s program. You will then need to test the classes by writing a console program to work with the classes. Objects will be created from the classes. These objects can then be used in the program in accordance with user input.
        </p>
        <p>
            Develop the classes listed in the bullet points below. Determine which classes should take advantage of inheritance and derive them accordingly. Each class should have at least 2 constructors. The first is the default constructor and the second is defined to your liking. All member variables must be defined in the constructors. Subclass constructors must invoke the base class constructor. Remember that anytime inheritance is used you should be able to say: &ltchild class name&gt is a &ltparent class name&gt. Example: Orange is a Fruit. If this statement doesn’t make sense, then inheritance should not be used in this way. Incorrect Example: Hero is an Inventory. Neither Hero or Inventory would be derived from one another. 
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the classes you must develop for this assignment.

                    <li>Lodging Review</li>           
                    <li>House (or Home)</li>
                 
                </ul>

            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer</li>
                    <li>Order Details</li>           
                   <li>Lodging </li>
                </ul>
            
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>
            The classes will need member variables. It is left as an exercise to the programmer to determine which class they belong to. Some of these members, like ‘name’ will go in multiple classes. Add 3 of your own unique variables to the Hotel class and 2 unique variables to the House class. Check out some hotel booking websites if you need ideas. Remember that a class is a blueprint for objects as they exist in the program. All variables listed below must be used and all classes have at least 2.

        <p>
            Add a display method to each class. When called this method will print the labeled values of the member variables. Subclasses should call the base class’s display method to show inherited values. Keep all output clean and professional. Decimal values should be formatted to show 2 decimal places.
        </p>
        <p>
           Choose at least 1 standalone class to have private variables. Provide getter and setter methods for the member variables of this class. All other classes and members may use default access 
        </p>
        <p>
            In main() create 5 instances of lodgings using your lowest levels of subclasses and the non-default constructors. Make sure the values are a little different from place to place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Call display() on all of the objects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Submission notes:
            Classes should be developed in separate files. Code must use the naming convention specified by the course instructor. Also be sure to follow all rules listed in the course and in the syllabus.
